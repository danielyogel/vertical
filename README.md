## Objectives

1. Declerative Ui description (full-stack planned)
2. Auto parent child relationship - parent aggregates children data, children auto-pass parent data.
3. Audo bindings of nodes by key.
4. Cross concern auto deps - for example disabled when loading
5. Statically typed API.
6. Statically typed data.
7. 100% cusomizable - prefer composability over inheritence and/or big config.
8. Dependecy Injection

## Commands

```bash
npm start # or yarn start
```

This builds to `/dist` and runs the project in watch mode so any edits you save inside `src` causes a rebuild to `/dist`.

Then run either Storybook or the example playground:

### Storybook

Run inside another terminal:

```bash
yarn storybook
```
